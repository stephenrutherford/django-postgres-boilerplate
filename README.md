# Django - React JS boilerplate with PostgreSQL
A boilerplate Django template for React JS with a PostgreSQL database.

## Backend

* clone repo
* start your virtual environement
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* open secret.json and replace placeholder strings with the correct information

If you don't have a secret key, you can generate a new one:

The Django settings.py file will already have redirects to React JS build/static assuming the app is called "frontend". You can rename this if needed. 



## Frontend

* CD to Django base directory
* `npm install -g create-react-app`
* create-react-app frontend
